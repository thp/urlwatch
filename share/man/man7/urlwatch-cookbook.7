.SH NAME
urlwatch-cookbook \- Advanced topics and recipes for urlwatch
.SH ADDING URLS FROM THE COMMAND LINE
.sp
Quickly adding new URLs to the job list from the command line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
urlwatch \-\-add url=http://example.org,name=Example
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH USING WORD-BASED DIFFERENCES
.sp
You can also specify an external \fBdiff\fP\-style tool (a tool that takes
two filenames (old, new) as parameter and returns on its standard output
the difference of the files), for example to use \fBwdiff(1)\fP to get
word\-based differences instead of line\-based difference, or \fI\%pandiff\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/davidar/pandiff\fP> to get markdown differences:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: https://example.com/
diff_tool: wdiff
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that \fBdiff_tool\fP specifies an external command\-line tool, so that
tool must be installed separately (e.g.\ \fBapt install wdiff\fP on Debian
or \fBbrew install wdiff\fP on macOS). Syntax highlighting is supported for
\fBwdiff\fP\-style output, but potentially not for other diff tools.
.SH IGNORING WHITESPACE CHANGES
.sp
If you would like to ignore whitespace changes so that you don\(aqt receive
notifications for trivial differences, you can use \fBdiff_tool\fP for this.
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
diff_tool: \(dqdiff \-\-ignore\-all\-space \-\-unified\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When using another external \fBdiff\fP\-like tool, make sure it returns unified
output format to retain syntax highlighting.
.SH ONLY SHOW ADDED OR REMOVED LINES
.sp
The \fBdiff_filter\fP feature can be used to filter the diff output text
with the same tools (see \fI\%Filters\fP) used for filtering web pages.
.sp
In order to show only diff lines with added lines, use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: http://example.com/things\-get\-added.html
diff_filter:
  \- grep: \(aq^[@+]\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will only keep diff lines starting with \fB@\fP or \fB+\fP\&. Similarly,
to only keep removed lines:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: http://example.com/things\-get\-removed.html
diff_filter:
  \- grep: \(aq^[@\-]\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
More sophisticated diff filtering is possibly by combining existing
filters, writing a new filter or using \fBshellpipe\fP to delegate the
filtering/processing of the diff output to an external tool.
.sp
Read the next section if you want to disable empty notifications.
.SH DISABLE EMPTY NOTIFICATIONS
.sp
As an extension to the previous example, let\(aqs say you want to only
get notified with all lines added, but receive no notifications at all
if lines are removed.
.sp
A diff usually looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\- @       Fri, 04 Mar 2022 19:58:14 +0100
+++ @       Fri, 04 Mar 2022 19:58:22 +0100
@@ \-1,3 +1,3 @@
 someline
\-someotherlines
+someotherline
 anotherline
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
We want to filter all lines starting with \(dq+\(dq only, but because of
the headers we also want to filter lines that start with \(dq+++\(dq,
which can be accomplished like so:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: http://example.com/only\-added.html
diff_filter:
  \- grep: \(aq^[+]\(aq      # Include all lines starting with \(dq+\(dq
  \- grepi: \(aq^[+]{3}\(aq  # Exclude the line starting with \(dq+++\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This deals with all diff lines now, but since urlwatch reports
\(dqchanged\(dq pages even when the \fBdiff_filter\fP returns an empty string
(which might be useful in some cases), you have to explicitly opt out
by using \fBurlwatch \-\-edit\-config\fP and setting the \fBempty\-diff\fP
option to \fBfalse\fP in the \fBdisplay\fP category:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
display:
  empty\-diff: false
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH PASS DIFF OUTPUT TO A CUSTOM SCRIPT
.sp
In some situations, it might be useful to run a script with the diff as input
when changes were detected (e.g. to start an update or process something). This
can be done by combining \fBdiff_filter\fP with the \fBshellpipe\fP filter, which
can be any custom script.
.sp
The output of the custom script will then be the diff result as reported by
urlwatch, so if it outputs any status, the \fBCHANGED\fP notification that
urlwatch does will contain the output of the custom script, not the original
diff. This can even have a \(dqnormal\(dq filter attached to only watch links
(the \fBcss: a\fP part of the filter definitions):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: http://example.org/downloadlist.html
filter:
  \- css: a
diff_filter:
  \- shellpipe: /usr/local/bin/process_new_links.sh
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH COMPARING WEB PAGES VISUALLY
.sp
To compare the visual contents of web pages, Nicolai has written
\fI\%pyvisualcompare\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/nspo/pyvisualcompare\fP> as
a frontend (with GUI) to \fBurlwatch\fP\&. The tool can be used to
select a region of a web page. It then generates a configuration
for \fBurlwatch\fP to run \fBpyvisualcompare\fP and generate a hash
for the screen contents.
.SH IGNORING CONNECTION ERRORS
.sp
In some cases, it might be useful to ignore (temporary) network errors
to avoid notifications being sent. While there is a \fBdisplay.error\fP
config option (defaulting to \fBtrue\fP) to control reporting of errors
globally, to ignore network errors for specific jobs only, you can use
the \fBignore_connection_errors\fP key in the job list configuration file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: https://example.com/
ignore_connection_errors: true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Similarly, you might want to ignore some (temporary) HTTP errors on the
server side:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: https://example.com/
ignore_http_error_codes: 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or ignore all HTTP errors if you like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: https://example.com/
ignore_http_error_codes: 4xx, 5xx
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH OVERRIDING THE CONTENT ENCODING
.sp
For web pages with misconfigured HTTP headers or rare encodings, it may
be useful to explicitly specify an encoding from Python’s \fI\%Standard
Encodings\fP <\fBhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings\fP>\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: https://example.com/
encoding: utf\-8
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH CHANGING THE DEFAULT TIMEOUT
.sp
By default, url jobs timeout after 60 seconds. If you want a different
timeout period, use the \fBtimeout\fP key to specify it in number of
seconds, or set it to 0 to never timeout.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: https://example.com/
timeout: 300
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH SUPPLYING COOKIE DATA
.sp
It is possible to add cookies to HTTP requests for pages that need it,
the YAML syntax for this is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: http://example.com/
cookies:
    Key: ValueForKey
    OtherKey: OtherValue
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH COMPARING WITH SEVERAL LATEST SNAPSHOTS
.sp
If a webpage frequently changes between several known stable states, it
may be desirable to have changes reported only if the webpage changes
into a new unknown state. You can use \fBcompared_versions\fP to do this.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: https://example.com/
compared_versions: 3
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, changes are only reported if the webpage becomes
different from the latest three distinct states. The differences are
shown relative to the closest match.
.SH RECEIVING A REPORT EVERY TIME URLWATCH RUNS
.sp
If you are watching pages that change seldomly, but you still want to
be notified daily if \fBurlwatch\fP still works, you can watch the output
of the \fBdate\fP command, for example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
name: \(dqurlwatch watchdog\(dq
command: \(dqdate\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since the output of \fBdate\fP changes every second, this job should produce a
report every time urlwatch is run.
.SH USING REDIS AS A CACHE BACKEND
.sp
If you want to use Redis as a cache backend over the default SQLite3 file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
urlwatch \-\-cache=redis://localhost:6379/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There is no migration path from the SQLite3 format, the cache will be empty
the first time Redis is used.
.SH WATCHING CHANGES ON .ONION (TOR) PAGES
.sp
Since pages on the \fI\%Tor Network\fP <\fBhttps://www.torproject.org\fP> are not accessible via public DNS and TCP,
you need to either configure a Tor client as HTTP/HTTPS proxy or use the
\fBtorify(1)\fP tool from the \fBtor\fP package (\fBapt install tor\fP on Debian,
\fBbrew install tor\fP on macOS). Setting up Tor is out of scope for this
document. On a properly set up Tor installation, one can just prefix the
\fBurlwatch\fP command with the \fBtorify\fP wrapper to access .onion pages:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
torify urlwatch
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH WATCHING FACEBOOK PAGE EVENTS
.sp
If you want to be notified of new events on a public Facebook page, you
can use the following job pattern, replace \fBPAGE\fP with the name of the
page (can be found by navigating to the events page on your browser):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: http://m.facebook.com/PAGE/pages/permalink/?view_type=tab_events
filter:
  \- css:
      selector: div#objects_container
      exclude: \(aqdiv.x, #m_more_friends_who_like_this, img\(aq
  \- re.sub:
      pattern: \(aq(/events/\ed*)[^\(dq]*\(aq
      repl: \(aq\e1\(aq
  \- html2text: pyhtml2text
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH SETTING THE CONTENT WIDTH FOR HTML2TEXT (LYNX METHOD)
.sp
When using the \fBlynx\fP method in the \fBhtml2text\fP filter, it uses a default
width that will cause additional line breaks to be inserted.
.sp
To set the \fBlynx\fP output width to 400 characters, use this filter setup:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: http://example.com/longlines.html
filter:
  \- html2text:
      method: lynx
      width: 400
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFIGURING HOW LONG BROWSER JOBS WAIT FOR PAGES TO LOAD
.sp
For browser jobs, you can configure how long the headless browser will wait
before a page is considered loaded by using the \fBwait_until\fP option.
.sp
It can take one of four values (see \fI\%wait_until docs\fP <\fBhttps://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-goto-option-wait-until\fP> of Playwright):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBload\fP \- consider operation to be finished when the load event is fired
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdomcontentloaded\fP \- consider operation to be finished when the
DOMContentLoaded event is fired
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnetworkidle\fP \- \fBdiscouraged\fP consider operation to be finished when there
are no network connections for at least 500 ms. Don\(aqt use this method for
testing, rely on web assertions to assess readiness instead
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcommit\fP \- consider operation to be finished when network response is
received and the document started loading
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH TREATING NEW JOBS AS CHANGED
.sp
In some cases (e.g. when the \fBdiff_tool\fP or \fBdiff_filter\fP executes some
external command as a side effect that should also run for the initial page
state), you can set the \fBtreat_new_as_changed\fP to \fBtrue\fP, which will make
the job report as \fBCHANGED\fP instead of \fBNEW\fP the first time it is retrieved
(and the diff will be reported, too).
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
url: http://example.com/initialpage.html
treat_new_as_changed: true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This option will also change the behavior of \fB\-\-test\-diff\-filter\fP, and allow
testing the diff filter if only a single version of the page has been
retrieved.
.SH MONITORING THE SAME URL IN MULTIPLE JOBS
.sp
Because urlwatch uses the \fBurl\fP/\fBnavigate\fP (for URL/Browser jobs) and/or
the \fBcommand\fP (for Shell jobs) key as unique identifier, each URL can only
appear in a single job. If you want to monitor the same URL multiple times,
you can append \fB#1\fP, \fB#2\fP, ... (or anything that makes them unique) to
the URLs, like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
name: \(dqLooking for Thing A\(dq
url: http://example.com/#1
filter:
  \- grep: \(dqThing A\(dq
\-\-\-
name: \(dqLooking for Thing B\(dq
url: http://example.com/#2
filter:
  \- grep: \(dqThing B\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH UPDATING A URL AND KEEPING PAST HISTORY
.sp
Job history is stored based on the value of the \fBurl\fP parameter, so updating
a job\(aqs URL in the configuration file \fBurls.yaml\fP will create a new job with
no history.  Retain history by using \fB\-\-change\-location\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
urlwatch \-\-change\-location http://example.org#old http://example.org#new
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The command also works with Browser and Shell jobs, changing \fBnavigate\fP and
\fBcommand\fP respectively.
.SH RUNNING A SUBSET OF JOBS
.sp
To run one or more specific jobs instead of all known jobs, provide
the job index numbers to the urlwatch command. For example, to run
jobs with index 2, 4, and 7:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
urlwatch 2 4 7
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH SENDING HTML FORM DATA USING POST
.sp
To simulate submitting a HTML form using the POST method, you can pass
the form fields in the \fBdata\fP field of the job description:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
name: \(dqMy POST Job\(dq
url: http://example.com/foo
data:
  username: \(dqfoo\(dq
  password: \(dqbar\(dq
  submit: \(dqSend query\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, the request will use the HTTP \fBPOST\fP method, and the
\fBContent\-type\fP will be set to \fBapplication/x\-www\-form\-urlencoded\fP\&.
.SH SENDING ARBITRARY DATA USING HTTP PUT
.sp
It is possible to customize the HTTP method and \fBContent\-type\fP header,
allowing you to send arbitrary requests to the server:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
name: \(dqMy PUT Request\(dq
url: http://example.com/item/new
method: PUT
headers:
  Content\-type: application/json
data: \(aq{\(dqfoo\(dq: true}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.SH UTF-8 SUPPORT ON WINDOWS
.sp
On Windows, the default file encoding might be locale\-specific and not work
correctly if files are saved using the (recommended) UTF\-8 encoding.
.sp
If you are having problems loading UTF\-8\-encoded files on Windows, you might
see an issue like the following when \fBurlwatch\fP parses your config files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
UnicodeDecodeError: \(aqcharmap\(aq codec can\(aqt decode byte 0x9d in position 214: character maps to <undefined>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To work around this issue, Python 3.7 and newer have a new
\fI\%UTF\-8 Mode\fP <\fBhttps://peps.python.org/pep-0540/\fP> that can be enabled by setting the environment
variable \fBPYTHONUTF8\fP to \fB1\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set PYTHONUTF8=1
urlwatch
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also add this environment variable to your user environment or system
environment to apply the UTF\-8 Mode to all Python programs on your machine.
