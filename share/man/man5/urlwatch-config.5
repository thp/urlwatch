.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
urlwatch \-\-edit\-config
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The global configuration for urlwatch contains basic settings for the generic
behavior of urlwatch as well as the reporters\&.
.SH DISPLAY
.sp
In addition to always reporting changes (which is the whole point of urlwatch),
urlwatch by default reports newly\-added (\fBnew\fP) pages and errors (\fBerror\fP).
You can change this behavior in the \fBdisplay\fP section of the configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
display:
  new: true
  error: true
  unchanged: false
  empty\-diff: true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you set \fBunchanged\fP to \fBtrue\fP, urlwatch will always report all pages
that are checked but have not changed.
.sp
The \fBempty\-diff\fP settings control what happens if a page is \fBchanged\fP, but
due to e.g. a \fBdiff_filter\fP the diff is reduced to the empty string. If set
to \fBtrue\fP, urlwatch will report an (empty) change. If set to \fBfalse\fP, the
change will not be included in the report.
.SS Filter changes are not applied for \fBunchanged\fP
.sp
Due to the way the filtered output is stored, \fBunchanged\fP will always report
the old contents with the filters at the time of retrieval, meaning that any
changes you do to the \fBfilter\fP of a job will not be visible in the
\fBunchanged\fP report. When the page changes, the new filter will be applied.
.sp
For this reason, \fBunchanged\fP cannot be used to test filters, you should use
the \fB\-\-test\-filter\fP command line option to apply your current filter to the
current page contents.
.SH REPORTERS
.sp
See \fBurlwatch\-reporters(5)\fP on the available reporters.
.sp
Here is an example configuration that reports on standard
output in color, as well as HTML e\-mail using \fBsendmail\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
report:
  text:
    details: true
    footer: true
    line_length: 75
  html:
    diff: unified
  email:
    enabled: true
    method: sendmail
    sendmail:
        path: /usr/sbin/sendmail
    from: \(aqurlwatch@example.org\(aq
    to: \(aqyou@example.org\(aq
    html: true
    subject: \(aq{count} changes: {jobs}\(aq
  stdout:
    color: true
    enabled: true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any reporter\-specific configuration must be below the \fBreport\fP key
in the configuration.
.sp
Configuration settings like \fBtext\fP, \fBhtml\fP and \fBmarkdown\fP will
apply to all reporters that derive from that reporter (for example,
the \fBstdout\fP reporter uses \fBtext\fP, while the \fBemail\fP reporter
with \fBhtml: true\fP set uses \fBhtml\fP).
.SH JOB DEFAULTS
.sp
If you want to change some settings for all your jobs, edit the
\fBjob_defaults\fP section in your config file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
job_defaults:
  all:
    diff_tool: wdiff
  url:
    ignore_connection_errors: true
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above config file sets all jobs to use \fBwdiff\fP as diff tool, and all
\fBurl\fP jobs to ignore connection errors.
.sp
The possible sub\-keys to \fBjob_defaults\fP are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBall\fP: Applies to all your jobs, independent of its kind
.IP \(bu 2
\fBshell\fP: Applies only to \fBshell\fP jobs (with key \fBcommand\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBurl\fP: Applies only to \fBurl\fP jobs (with key \fBurl\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbrowser\fP: Applies only to \fBbrowser\fP jobs (with key \fBnavigate\fP)
.UNINDENT
.sp
See jobs about the different job kinds and what the possible keys are.
