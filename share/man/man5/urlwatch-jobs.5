.SH NAME
urlwatch-jobs \- Job types and configuration for urlwatch
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
urlwatch \-\-edit
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Jobs are the kind of things that \fBurlwatch(1)\fP can monitor.
.sp
The list of jobs to run are contained in the configuration file \fBurls.yaml\fP,
accessed with the command \fBurlwatch \-\-edit\fP, each separated by a line
containing only \fB\-\-\-\fP\&. The command \fBurlwatch \-\-list\fP prints the name
of each job, along with its index number (1, 2, 3, ...) which gets assigned
automatically according to its position in the configuration file.
.sp
While optional, it is recommended that each job starts with a \fBname\fP entry:

.sp
.nf
.ft C

.SH BROWSER
.sp
This job type is a resource\-intensive variant of \(dqURL\(dq to handle web pages that
require JavaScript to render the content being monitored.
.sp
The optional \fIplaywright\fP package must be installed in order to run Browser jobs
(see \fI\%Dependencies\fP). You will also need to install the browsers using
\fBplaywright install\fP (see \fI\%Playwright Installation\fP <\fBhttps://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro\fP> for details).
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
name: \(dqA page with JavaScript\(dq
navigate: \(dqhttps://example.org/\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Required keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnavigate\fP: URL to navigate to with the browser
.UNINDENT
.sp
Job\-specific optional keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwait_until\fP: Either \fBload\fP, \fBdomcontentloaded\fP, \fBnetworkidle\fP, or
\fBcommit\fP (see \fI\%Advanced Topics\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwait_for\fP: A CSS or XPath selector based on the
: \fI\%https://playwright.dev/python/docs/locators#locate\-by\-css\-or\-xpath\fP
spec. The job will wait for the default timeout of 30 seconds.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBuseragent\fP: \fBUser\-Agent\fP header used for requests (otherwise browser default is used)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbrowser\fP:  Either \fBchromium\fP, \fBchrome\fP, \fBchrome\-beta\fP, \fBmsedge\fP,
\fBmsedge\-beta\fP, \fBmsedge\-dev\fP, \fBfirefox\fP, \fBwebkit\fP (must be installed with \fBplaywright install\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBbrowser_path\fP: Path to a custom browser executable for Playwright to use instead of its managed browser (e.g. \fB/usr/bin/chromium\fP)
.UNINDENT
.sp
Because this job uses \fI\%Playwright\fP <\fBhttps://playwright.dev/python/\fP> to
render the page in a headless browser instance, it uses massively more resources
than a \(dqURL\(dq job. Use it only on pages where \fBurl\fP does not return the correct
results. In many cases, instead of using a \(dqBrowser\(dq job, you can use the output
of an API called by the page as it loads, which contains the information you are
you\(aqre looking for by using the much faster \(dqURL\(dq job type.
.sp
(Note: \fBnavigate\fP implies \fBkind: browser\fP)
.SH SHELL
.sp
This job type allows you to watch the output of arbitrary shell commands,
which is useful for e.g. monitoring an FTP uploader folder, output of
scripts that query external devices (RPi GPIO), etc...
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
name: \(dqWhat is in my Home Directory?\(dq
command: \(dqls \-al ~\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Required keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcommand\fP: The shell command to execute
.UNINDENT
.sp
Job\-specific optional keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstderr\fP: Change how standard error is treated, see below
.UNINDENT
.sp
(Note: \fBcommand\fP implies \fBkind: shell\fP)
.SS Configuring \fBstderr\fP behavior for shell jobs
.sp
By default urlwatch captures \fBstderr\fP for error reporting (non\-zero exit
code), but ignores the output when the shell job exits with exit code 0.
.sp
This behavior can be customized using the \fBstderr\fP key:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBignore\fP: Capture \fBstderr\fP, report on non\-zero exit code, ignore otherwise (default)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBurlwatch\fP: \fBstderr\fP of the shell job is sent to \fBstderr\fP of the \fBurlwatch\fP process;
any error message on \fBstderr\fP will not be visible in the error message from the reporter
(legacy default behavior of urlwatch 2.24 and older)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfail\fP: Treat the job as failed if there is \fIany\fP output on \fBstderr\fP, even with exit status 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstdout\fP: Merge \fBstderr\fP output into \fBstdout\fP, which means stderr output is also considered
for the change detection/diff part of urlwatch (this is similar to \fB2>&1\fP in a shell)
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, this job definition will make the job appear as failed,
even though the script exits with exit code 0:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
command: |
  echo \(dqNormal standard output.\(dq
  echo \(dqSomething goes to stderr, which makes this job fail.\(dq 1>&2
  exit 0
stderr: fail
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
On the other hand, if you want to diff both stdout and stderr of the job, use this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
command: |
  echo \(dqAn important line on stdout.\(dq
  echo \(dqAnother important line on stderr.\(dq 1>&2
stderr: stdout
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONAL KEYS FOR ALL JOB TYPES

\fBname\fP: Human\-readable name/label of the job
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fBkind\fP (redundant): Either \fBurl\fP, \fBshell\fP or \fBbrowser\fP\&.  Automatically derived from the unique key (\fBurl\fP, \fBcommand\fP or \fBnavigate\fP) of the job type
.IP \(bu 2
\fBuser_visible_url\fP: Different URL to show in reports (e.g. when watched URL is a REST API URL, and you want to show a webpage)

\fBenabled\fP: Can be set to false to disable an individual job (default is \fBtrue\fP)
.UNINDENT
.SH SETTING KEYS FOR ALL JOBS AT ONCE
.sp
The main \fI\%Configuration\fP file has a \fBjob_defaults\fP
key that can be used to configure keys for all jobs at once.
.sp
See \fBurlwatch\-config(5)\fP for how to configure job defaults.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
See \fBurlwatch\-cookbook(7)\fP for example job configurations.
