# Example urlwatch.yaml
# Controls global behaviour: what changes are reported, how reports are delivered,
# and defaults applied to all jobs. Unlike urls.yaml, this is usually a single file.

# Which job states appear in reports
display:
  error: true        # Failed jobs (network, HTTP, runtime errors)
  new: true          # First run (no cached data yet)
  unchanged: false   # Suppress unchanged content
  empty-diff: false  # Suppress changes reduced to empty by diff filters

# How reports are generated and delivered
report:
  stdout:
    enabled: true
    color: true
  text:
    details: true
    footer: true
    line_length: 75
    diff: unified

# Default settings applied by job type

  browser:
    # Use an existing system browser for all Playwright-based navigate jobs
    # (avoids downloading Playwright-managed browsers).
    #
    # Can be overridden per job, or set to null to use Playwright defaults.
