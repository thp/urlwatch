# This is an example urls.yaml file for urlwatch

# A basic URL job just needs a URL
name: "urlwatch webpage"
url: "https://thp.io/2008/urlwatch/"
# You can use a pre-supplied filter for this, here we apply two:
# the html2text filter that converts the HTML to plaintext and
# the grep filter that filters lines based on a regular expression
filter:
  - html2text
  - grep: "Current.*version"
  - strip
---
# Built-in job kind "shell" needs a command specified
name: "Home Listing"
command: "ls -al ~"
#---
#name: "Login to some webpage (custom job)"
#url: "http://example.org/"
# This job kind is defined in hooks.py, so you need to enable it
#kind: custom-login
# Additional parameters for the custom-login job kind can be specified here
#username: "myuser"
#password: "secret"
# Filters can be specified here, separated by comma (these are also from hooks.py)
#filter: case:upper,indent:5
---
# If you want to use spaces in URLs, you have to URL-encode them (e.g. %20)
url: "http://example.org/With%20Spaces/"
---
# POST requests are done by providing a post parameter
url: "http://example.com/search.cgi"
data: "button=Search&q=something&category=4"
---
# You can use a custom HTTP method, this might be useful for cache invalidation
url: "http://example.com/foo"
method: "PURGE"
---
# You can do POST requests by providing data parameter.
# POST data can be a URL-encoded string (see last example) or a dict.
# If you are using the URL multiple times, you need to append "#something" for
# each different job, so that the URL string still uniquely identifies the job
url: "http://example.com/search.cgi#alternative"
data:
  button: Search
  q: something
  category: 4

# Browser jobs using Playwright to render JavaScript-heavy pages
# You can use 'navigate' instead of 'url' for pages that require JS rendering
name: "Page requiring JavaScript (system browser)"

# Specify a custom browser path instead of using Playwright's managed browser
browser_path: "/usr/bin/chromium"
---
name: "Page using default Playwright browser"
navigate: "https://example.com/"
browser: "chromium"
# browser_path not specified - uses Playwright's managed browser installation
---
# Override global browser_path setting (if configured in urlwatch.yaml)
name: "Explicitly use Playwright managed browser"
navigate: "https://example.io/"
browser: "chromium"
# Explicitly set to null to override any global default
